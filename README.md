# MOBILE-PRICE-ANALYSIS üì±
This project explores smartphone datasets to analyze pricing patterns across brands. By studying features like RAM, battery, storage, and camera, and applying Python-based analysis with visualizations, it uncovers insights into customer value, market trends, and brand positioning strategies.

 üìå **Overview**

The Mobile Price Analysis project focuses on exploring and understanding the relationship between mobile phone specifications and their pricing trends. With smartphones being an integral part of daily life, the mobile industry is highly competitive, and analyzing the factors that affect pricing can help both customers and manufacturers make informed decisions.
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about mobile phones from various brands. Common features include company/brand, model, price, RAM, storage capacity, battery power (mAh), camera specifications, display size, operating system, and weight. These attributes provide a foundation for studying how technical specifications and brand reputation influence market pricing.
The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where missing values, inconsistent entries, and unit mismatches are handled. Once the dataset is prepared, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns. This includes analyzing price distributions, comparing average prices among brands, and studying correlations between price and features like RAM, storage, or battery. Visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and Heatmap are created using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
From the analysis, meaningful insights are drawn. For example, premium brands like Apple and Samsung dominate the high-price segment, while companies such as Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo target budget and mid-range customers. Features such as RAM, storage, and battery capacity often emerge as strong predictors of pricing.
This project demonstrates practical application of data analysis, visualization, and interpretation to derive actionable business insights from real-world datasets.
